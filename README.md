# Customer Segmentation in E-Commerce

 
<p align='justify'> An e-commerce startup based in Brazil recently opened an online website to sell their product. They launch the website when the covid-19 hits and making them grow faster than ever. But, the startup is still not using targeted marketing which hurts their marketing budget as only a fraction of their user comes back to their website. The goal is to increase their marketing conversion rate by doing customer segmentation analysis to understand the customer's behaviour and planning targeted marketing strategy so that it will not hurt the budget anymore. </p>

### There are two main objectives for this project :
- Give insights from the datasets for better understanding their current business performance.
- Create customer segmentation using cluster analysis in order to help the e-commerce to understand their customer better and plan a suitable marketing strategy for business.

### There are several questions that need to be answered in this project :
1. How long does it take from purchase time to carrier and from carrier to customer?
2. Is there any sales trend based on number of orders?
3. How is the total sales in each month?
4. How is Average Order Value in each month?
5. Which day of the week is the busiest?
6. What is the most favourite payment type?
7. Where are the customers coming from?
8. Which state contributes the most to total sales in Jan 2018 - Aug 2018?
9. What time does customer usually do purchase in the e-commerce?
10. Which state has the lowest Average Revenue Per Customer in Jan 2018 - Aug 2018?
